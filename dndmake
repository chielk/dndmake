"""
Openness to experience: (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious).
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety
of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity,
creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also
described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent, and
depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict
routine. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret the openness factor,
which is sometimes called "intellect" rather than openness to experience.

Conscientiousness: (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless). A tendency to
be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for
achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior.

Extraversion: (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved). Energy, positive
emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek
stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness.

Agreeableness: (friendly/compassionate vs. analytical/detached). A tendency to
be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic
towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and
whether a person is generally well tempered or not.

Neuroticism: (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident). The tendency to
experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and
vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and
impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional
stability".
